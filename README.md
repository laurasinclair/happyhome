# HappyHome

HappyHome is an admin dashboard for an apartment rental platform, where the admin can see and manage the apartments shown on the platform.
Developed with React.js, Bootstrap, and Sass, it offers an intuitive, accessible, and responsive interface. By using local storage to prevent unnecessary API calls, it ensures efficient performance, enabling admins to easily manage apartment listings.
